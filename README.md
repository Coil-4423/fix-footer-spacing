### **Note: Fixing Footer Alignment and Removing Extra Space with `flex-grow`**

#### **Issue:**
When there is not enough content on the page, an unwanted space appears **below the footer**. The footer stays in the middle of the page if the content does not stretch to the bottom, leaving a visible gap when zooming out or on larger screens.

#### **Cause:**
This issue happens because the **layout container** or the **main content area** does not fill the entire height of the screen. As a result:
- The **footer** stays just below the content.
- The remaining space between the footer and the bottom of the viewport becomes empty, creating an unwanted gap.

#### **Solution: Using `flex-grow` to Fix the Layout**

1. **What is `flex-grow`?**
   - The `flex-grow` property controls how much an element should grow **in proportion to other elements** within a Flexbox container.
   - In a Flexbox layout, `flex-grow: 1` ensures that an element takes up any **available space** inside the container.

2. **How `flex-grow` Fixes the Footer Issue:**
   By applying `flex-grow: 1` to the **main content section**, we ensure that the content expands to fill the available space, **pushing the footer to the bottom**. This ensures there is no extra white space below the footer, regardless of screen size.

### **Steps to Implement the Fix**

1. **HTML/JSX Layout Structure:**

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';
import Footer from './Footer';
import styles from "@/app/css/Layout.module.css";

const Layout = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.layout}>
      <Header />
      <main className={styles.main}>{children}</main> {/* Main content area */}
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Layout;
```

2. **CSS Code:**

```css
/* Layout container */
.layout {
  min-height: 100vh; /* Ensure the layout fills the full viewport height */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; /* Arrange children vertically */
}

/* Main content */
.main {
  flex-grow: 1; /* Allow the main content to grow and take available space */
}

/* Footer */
footer {
  position: relative;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 64rem;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-top: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.404);
  color: #fff;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

3. **Explanation:**

- **`layout` class**:
  - Sets the minimum height of the layout to **100vh** (100% of the viewport height).
  - Uses **Flexbox** to arrange the elements (`Header`, `main`, and `Footer`) vertically.

- **`main` class**:
  - The `flex-grow: 1` ensures that the main content **expands to take up any remaining space**.
  - This **pushes the footer to the bottom** of the page, eliminating any extra white space.

- **Footer**:
  - Remains at the bottom of the page, thanks to the `flex-grow` behavior in the main section.

---

### **When to Use This Solution:**
- If your footer appears **in the middle of the page** when content is minimal.
- When you need a **sticky footer** that stays at the bottom of the viewport without creating unwanted empty space.

---

### **Summary:**
Using **`flex-grow: 1`** ensures that the main content expands to fill the available space inside the layout. This prevents any unwanted space between the footer and the bottom of the viewport, ensuring a clean and consistent layout across all screen sizes.
